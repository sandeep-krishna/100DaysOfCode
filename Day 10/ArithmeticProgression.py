Arthmetic Progression

You will be given three numbers A,B,C .You can perform the following operation on these numbers any number of times.You can take any integer from A, B, C and you can add or substract 1 from it.

Each operation cost 1sec of time(say). Now you have to determine the minimum time required to change those numbers into an Arithmetic Progression. 

i.e B-A=C-B

Input :
First line of input contains T denoting number of test cases.

Next T lines contains space seperated integers A,B,C

Output :
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum time require to change A,B,C into an arithmetic progression.

Constraints :
